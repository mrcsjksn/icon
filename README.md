# ICON
## for trombone and audiovisual electronics

#### Programme Note

ICON presents a making ready––or making real––of the trombonist and trombone. The idea of performance practise brings with it an anticipation that arises from historically repeated cause-and-effect chains: we see a certain gesture and expect a certain sounding result, etc. This work decouples the instrument from the performer, the sound from the gesture, and the real from the virtual, and in doing so, allows the performer to become a site for the exploration of the body as signifier (or disingenuous initiator) in performance. ICON brings into question the role of characterised portrayal within the context of a cultural canon, and explores notions of obsessive, fixated, and disjunctive personal presentations.
